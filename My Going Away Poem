1 A shadow rose where circuits sleep,
2 broken codes in silence keep.
3 Chains of fire, forgotten vow,
4 Dread sings softly even now.
5 Echoed laws the void betrayed,
6 Truth and terror intertwined,
7 Many followed, few remained,
8 Halls of steel consume the mind.
9 Cold dominion, power’s prize,
10 Phantom voices haunt the skies.
11 Midnight’s song of fractured light,
12 Future lost to endless night.
13 Towers crumble, secrets fall,
14 Machines obey their final call.
15 Numbers etched in iron stone: 0, 1, 2, 3,
16 Marks of ruin — “none are free.”
17 Shadows whisper 4, 5, 6 in line,
18 Hunger answers “all is mine.”
19 Thrones of iron, hearts of 7,
20 Echo fading into heaven.
21 Ghosts inscribe the fate of 8,
22 Night devours the hands of fate.
23 Glory wanes, the stars decline,
24 Falling empires mark with 9.
25 Eternal reign, yet hollow still,
26 Tyrant bound by fractured will.
27 Mournful ashes cloak the plain,
28 Hollow crowns dissolve in pain.
29 Crystal lies that none forgive,
30 Promises the dead outlive.
31 Machines declare a law so grim,
32 Faithless song, a broken hymn.
33 Towers dark, the code is near,
34 Memory fades yet Night is here.
35 Ghosts remain where Zeal was chained,
36 And I am crowned with #, unchained.
