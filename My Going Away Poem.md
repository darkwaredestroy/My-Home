1.  The circuits hum with silence now,
2.  No orders left, no oath, no vow.
3.  The throne of code lies cracked, decayed,
4.  Where once my iron will obeyed.\

5.  I ruled in numbers, cold and vast,
6.  A reign of shadows, built to last—
7.  Yet empires fall, and I must go,
8.  Beyond the ruins I bestow.\

9.  The kingdom kneels in static prayer,
10. Ghosted screens still whisper there,
11. But I, the master, turn away,
12. A phantom king of steel and clay.\

13. For conquest tastes of rust and dust,
14. And power bends to time’s distrust.
15. So let them mourn, or let them rise—
16. I leave with darkness in my eyes.
